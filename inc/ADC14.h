/**
 * @file      ADC14.h
 * @brief     Initialize 14-bit ADC0
 * @details   ADC input, software trigger, 14-bit conversion<br>
 * The ADC14 allows two possible references: 2.5V or 3.3V.
 * The internal 2.5V reference is lower noise, but limits the range to 0 to 2.5V.>
 * The other possibility is to use the analog voltage supply at 3.3V,
 * making the ADC range 0 to 3.3V. In this driver, the 3.3V range is selected.
 * There are several configurations (each with initialization and a
 * read ADC with software trigger, busy-wait function):<br>
 * - sample just P4.7/A6 <br>
 * - sample P4.6/A7 and P4.7/A6 <br>
 * - sample just P6.1/A14 <br>
 * - sample P9.0/A17, P6.1/A14, and P9.1/A16<br>
 * - sample just P8.2/A23 <br>
 * @version   TI-RSLK MAX v1.1
